        <p>From January 2017 - September 2017 I worked at SAP as an Agile Developer intern. I was working in the Infrastructure team which was responsible
          for a mixture of front end and back end programming. Working as an intern at SAP had me working on SAP
          Analytics Cloud. I fixed bugs that I assigned myself or my supervisor assigned me. Once I finished a certain task I used Git to push my code to
          Gerrit. Gerrit is a web based collaboration software that would allow me to push my code up and have it reviewed by my fellow workers. Code always get reviewed
          and needs a +2 rating by another colleague in order to get merged into our workstream. During my time there I also provided code reviews, adding comments and asking questions
          so the code that would get merged would work as intended and be of high quality. I learned a lot during this reviewing process as other colleagues pointed out
          more efficient solutions that would also fix the bug and my code quality vastly improved month to month.

        <p>
          During my first 4 months I had a buddy, who was the prior co-op student, to provide any assistance that I needed to get more comfortable working there. He
          was able to mentor me and show me the ropes. During my last 4 months I was the mentor/buddy to the new co-op student that came in. I showed him efficient
          ways to approach problems and how to go about fixing bugs. I also reviewed his code so he would learn the proper coding practice that is required.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every wave, roughly 2 weeks, would be a new release with new features. Our team was responsible for certain features in SAP Analytics Cloud and I was tasked to test our
          features twice every wave (regression testing & release testing) in order to make sure our features were working as expected. If a problem arose then I would investigate
          to see how it broke and who broke it. I would then assign it to the correct team to fix or I would fix it myself so there would not be a regression in the release.
        </p>

        <p>
          Regression testing would be time consuming as the tasks were very repetitive so in my last two months I decided to automate some of our tests. I used
          the Jasmine framework to automate our UI test cases and some of our back end tests. By the end of it I had automated 25% of our test cases which significantly
          improved the speed and time it would take to complete our regression testing.
        </p>

        <p>A large feature that I was fortunate to work on was helping to move all of the SAP Analytics Cloud static assets to a Content Delivery Network. For more information
          on this you can view my technical report <a href="#techincalReport">here</a>.
