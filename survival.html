        <p>The objective of this project was to create a simulation using Java with Eclipse. The principles of classes, polymorphism
           and encapsulation were used to create this program in addition to adding features such as mouse input and sound effects.
        </p>

        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>I researched other simulations that people made with Java to learn and adapt from while I was brainstorming and sketching
          during my ideation process. I finalized the core idea of my program to be a tree cutting and fire making simulation. One
          inspiration of mine for this idea was from an online game I used to play when I was younger which included different skills
          including fire making and tree cutting.
        </p>

        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>By sketching out each step that would occur as well as having UML diagrams, it was easier to communicate to the instructor
          and teaching assistant during my proposal. Initially, I created ellipses and rectangles as placeholders for all my objects in
           order to check if all the detection worked correctly. Once each collision was working I slowly added more details to the entire
           program. A strong skill I possess is time management, so throughout the duration of this project I programmed in iterations with
            set milestones in order to apply polish to the final product. A portion of the final UML diagram can be seen below and the full
            UML diagram can be seen <a class="in-text-link" href="img/finalUML.pdf">here.</a>

      <div class="project-content">
        <p>Creating a UML diagram was helpful to plan out the major classes along with the variables and functions each one would
           require. In doing so, programming each class was done efficiently and without a major hassle. A major key to this program
            was collision detection in which I passed in objects as parameters in the collision methods. This set the foundation for
            the rest of the program. As a result of good time management I had the opportunity to keep adding more features such as
            sound effects for each interaction and background effects such as rain.

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>A major challenge I encountered was with the sound effects. When I tried to play the sound effect at the time of an
          interaction, the sound effect would repeat each frame in which they were in contact. Since the program runs at 60 frames per
           second the sound would overlap 60 times. This was problematic as it slowed down my whole program. After attempting various
           solutions I came up with the solution to play the sound effect based on a timer. Therefore the sound effect would only play
            when the timer reached a certain frame when the timer was incremented.
        </p>

        <h3>Outcome & Insights</h3>
        <p>The final product turned out to be a well-executed and polished simulation. By planning out the program beforehand using UML
           diagrams I was able to program without major difficulty due to the fact that I had an idea of what variables and methods to
            use as well as the relationship between the classes. The only issue I have with this would be the artwork. Creating images
             with a consistent style isn't my strong suit but I am very happy how the programming side turned out with all the object
              interactions. If I were to do this again or had more time I would add more steps to make the simulation longer. I also
               would like to make it a never ending program. By that I mean to adding components to the program that the player can
               do after the fire has been built, such as cooking food, eating or hunting.
